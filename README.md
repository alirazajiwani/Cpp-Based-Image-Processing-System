# Cpp-Based Image Processing System

A modular **C++ image processing system** designed to demonstrate fundamental image processing operations using a clean project structure, custom implementations, and build automation via **Makefile**.

This project is suitable for learning purposes, academic projects, and as a base for extending more advanced image processing pipelines.

---

## 📌 Features

* Image loading and saving
* Basic image processing operations (e.g. filtering, transformations, pixel-level manipulation)
* Modular design using `src/` and `include/`
* Sample images included for testing
* Makefile-based build system
